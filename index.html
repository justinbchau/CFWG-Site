                  Hi my name is Sokphanna Keo. I go by Peter, I been in San Jose all my life. 
                  I was introduced to crossfit in 2012 in my mid-20s by a mutual family member of military background. I never played sports in high school and was not extremely athletic coming into this new sport. I would dabble going to global gyms and played some basketball with friends. When I left my first gym in 2015 I found Crossfit Willow Glen and stayed ever since. What surprised me to this day is how much I improved and advanced in weightlifting which boosted a confidence physically and personally formed close bonds I didnt know I needed at the time. Two years into coaching, what I see and am most proud of are the improvements in all aspects of the gym members and the social skills I never knew I had in myself until now and onwards. Besides Crossfit I also collect sneakers.

                  Why you do CrossFit and how do you use CF outside of the gym
                  I fell in love with Crossfit from the first day I entered my first box.  The community, the competition, and the strength, mentally and physically, were all like something I had never experienced before. Every day you get better. 
                  Crossfit has been a part of my life for over 5 years and I wouldn't have it any other way. 
                  Outside the gym, Crossfit provides me structure, routine, and toughness. 
                  As well as the ability to carry my all groceries in one trip up three flights of stairs to my apartment. Major Win.
  
                  Why you LOVE CFWG and how you found out about it yourself
                  I love CFWG. The members are some of the most genuine and committed athletes and people you will ever meet. Athletes of all ages, all skill levels, and all with the same love and passion for the sport. 
                  I literally walked into a 5a class, being brand new to San Jose, and it was a quick decision to say, that CFWG would be my new box.
                  CFWG has truly become a family to me and I am very lucky and fortunate for that. 
  
                  I found CFWG through a search of many gyms in San Jose, looking around at all the gyms close to my apartment. CFWG's schedule has plenty of classes as well as providing an open gym on the weekends. I felt with my complex schedule and determination to fit Crossfit in, CFWG provided the best flexibility. Additionally, the members and staff instantly made me feel like I was a part of this community. 
                  I love that I found CFWG!
  
                    Why you chose to coach CrossFit
                    I chose to coach CrossFit to help deliver and share the passion I have for this sport. Allowing athletes to reach a potential they didn't know they had. Celebrating with the classes at the end of a WOD and knowing every one gave it their 100% effort.
                    Leading these moments, there is no better feeling.  
  
                    Misc. things you want to add.
                    I can't keep chalk in the chalk bucket, don't be like me.

                  I do CrossFit to consistently challenge myself and get better every day. I consistently have to carry and move heavy objects for work and CF has helped me with making this task so much easier and efficient!
                  I love CFWG because of how family oriented we are! I was brought here by my brother and have been here ever since.
                  I choose to coach because I love helping people and watching them progress in their journey!

                  I do CrossFit because my passion is fitness and health and CrossFit gives me all of that and also the addition of community. I have always been an athlete and before Crossfit I was always in the gym lifting weights and running outside (and did those by myself). When I found CrossFit, I found out that I was able to get those 2 things and so much more in a fitness environment of varying intensity, variety, friendly competition and that sense of being part of a something. I use CrossFit outside of the gym by having it as my main training tool for staying fit and for my Masters Track and Field competitions. CrossFit allows me to strengthen all aspects of my body and fitness, which helps me for my competition running, and for my general health in everyday life.

                  Why you LOVE CFWG and how you found out about it yourself
                  I found CFWG in 2012 when a friend of mine recommended I try it. I have to say that I was skeptical and was happy (I thought) with my current workout regimen. When I finally got talked into it, I was introduced to Audra and CFWG with an introductory class and I was hooked. I signed up, took the On Ramp class and I was off and running at CFWG, being one of the many in the "early crew" at 5am. It was such an inviting environment and everyone was so friendly and welcoming, and I felt like I had been part of the family for a while. Now, so many years later, it still feels that same way.

                  Why you chose to coach CrossFit
                  I chose to coach Crossfit for a few reasons, one of the main one being that I wanted to give back to the community the passion that I felt each time I stepped into the CrossFit gym and did the workout of the day. The other was to show that anyone can do this, with proper training, especially anyone who is 50+ (as I am). I found out quickly that as an older athlete (or any athlete for that matter) there are "rules" your body needs to follow, whether you like it or not. Sometimes you have setbacks such as injuries, which I have had my share, and the ability to come back from those is as important as following a program when you are healthy. To be able to impart some of that "wisdom" is also a reason why I coach.

                  Misc. things you want to add.
                  Being a CFWG coach and athlete helps me understand how Crossfit fits into my fitness plan and also has allowed me to better understand how it could fit into someone's own plan for their fitness. I currently coach my co-workers at the company where I work (a start up in the hi tech industry) with 2 classes per week .This allows me to coach individuals that may not think they are athletes (they are) and to help them realize a level of fitness they may not have thought about or thought was possible. .

                  I do Crossfit as a way to stay healthy and fit and also as a stress relief. I most readily use Crossfit outside of the gym in my profession as a police officer and a firefighter. I use it as a means to always be fit and ready for anything that I may encounter on the job and to help constantly prepare me for the unknown.

                  I love CFWG because it’s always felt like a home to me. The people are like family and it’s a place that I know I can always count on to come to. Even if life makes it difficult to get there for periods of time, I know that it’s somewhere I’m always welcome and encouraged when I’m there. The environment is lighthearted and motivating all at the same time. My mom was the one who introduced me to Crossfit and to CFWG back in 2012, when I was first starting to take physical exercise and health seriously.

                  I chose to coach CrossFit because I felt like it was a way for me to introduce people, who may be struggling to find a regimented way of exercising, to something challenging, exciting and ultimately fulfilling. I enjoy coaching beginners or people who are new to Crossfit because it gives me the opportunity to help lay the foundation for them to be successful and I take pride in seeing those people day in and day out setting and achieving goals and excelling in things they doubted at the start. Coaching Crossfit also helps me to learn more about what I’m teaching and about myself.

                  I’m in the gym a lot. Working out is basically my favorite hobby. If you see me around the gym say hello, I’m always around as a friendly face and here to help.

                  I started CrossFit 7 years ago when I found a Groupon for CrossFit Willow Glen.  The one month trial membership turned into a love for CrossFit and the CFWG community.  There are two main reasons that I do CrossFit:  first is that I try to stay in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle and second is that I love the community here at CFWG.  I can count on getting a great workout in and hanging out with fun like-minded people.  I have made many lifelong friends as a member of CFWG. 

 

                  I got into coaching to help give back to the community that has given me so much.  I have fun interacting with the athletes and helping them become better.  It always makes my day when an athlete hits a PR or gets a movement that has eluded them.

 

                  Outside of the gym I love the outdoors.  I volunteer as a leader for my son’s Boy Scout troop and love going hiking a camping with the troop. CrossFit definitely helps me keep up with the young boys on the 10-20 mile hikes!  I am also an avid Snowboarder and try to get up to the mountains any chance I can get.  I never get sore after boarding thanks to CrossFit!  I’m also a huge sports fan and follow the Giants, Warriors and 49ers.
